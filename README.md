# hello-world
Just a repository test (mic check, mic check, testing 1-2-3)

Hello world!! Just testing out GitHub. This is my first time ever using Git, so please bear with me. 
Eventually, I'd like to add more meaningful projects (or even school assignments/projects) on here. I think
it'll be cool to look back one of these days and see how much progress I've made and how much I've grown
during my endeavors in studying computer science since starting last year (May 2014).

I would also like to note that I love coffee, making music (yes, I do compose original music too), and learning
languages--including programming languages.
